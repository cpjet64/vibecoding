# VibeCoding

Welcome to VibeCoding, a collaborative space dedicated to the art and practice of coding with vibes. This repository aims to collect wisdom, techniques, and insights about the human aspects of programming that often go undiscussed.

## What is VibeCoding?

VibeCoding is about recognizing that programming isn't just a technical disciplineâ€”it's a deeply human activity influenced by our psychology, environment, and emotional state. This repository explores how to:

- Enhance your coding flow state
- Create environments conducive to productive programming
- Navigate the emotional aspects of software development
- Build better mental models for complex systems
- Leverage intuition and pattern recognition in coding
