# Vendor Contacts: Building Bridges to Your Tech Ecosystem ü§ù

As vibe coders, we recognize that our systems don't exist in isolation‚Äîthey're interconnected with a broader ecosystem of services and tools provided by vendors. Managing these relationships mindfully is an essential practice in maintaining harmonious systems. This guide explores how to document and cultivate vendor relationships in a way that supports your technical and human needs.
